### Summary
Classic Iowa Electronic Markets paper. Compares election prediction markets to **964 contemporary polls** over five US presidential elections.

### Key Findings
- Markets are **more accurate than polls ~74% of the time**
- Advantage is strongest **further from election day**
- Markets aggregate dispersed information more efficiently than polling averages

### Relevance
Anchor citation for "betting improves forecasts vs traditional instruments." Establishes the empirical baseline that prediction markets work.

| **Venue** | NBER Working Paper / Handbook of Economic Forecasting chapter |

### Summary
Comprehensive survey of prediction markets as economic forecasters. Covers theory, empirics, and interpretation of market prices as probabilities.

### Key Findings
- Markets often **match or beat traditional macro forecasters**
- Prices can be interpreted as probability estimates (with caveats)
- Markets fail when: low liquidity, manipulation risk, or misspecified contracts
- Markets work best when: clear resolution criteria, sufficient traders, real stakes

### Relevance
Authoritative overview from top economists. Good for "when markets work, when they fail" framing.

## 3. Are Markets More Accurate than Polls? The Surprising Informational Value of "Just Asking"

### Summary
Compares prediction markets to "prediction polls" where individuals state probability estimates directly.

### Key Findings
- Well-designed polls **can rival markets** in accuracy
- The power comes from **aggregation mechanics**, not magic market participants
- "Just asking" people for probabilities (not vote intentions) is surprisingly effective
- Markets add value via **incentives** and **continuous updating**, not unique wisdom

### Relevance
Important nuance: markets aren't magic—the aggregation mechanism is what works. Supports designing better polling/forecasting hybrids.

## 4. A Comparison of Forecasting Methods: Fundamentals, Polling, Prediction Markets, and Experts

| **Year** | 2015 |
| **Venue** | *Journal of Prediction Markets* |
| **Link** | [CMU PDF](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak/papers/jpm15.pdf) |

### Summary
Uses **Oscar predictions** as a clean laboratory to compare forecast methods: fundamentals, polls, prediction markets, and expert opinions.

### Key Findings
- Prediction markets are **consistently among the best-performing methods**
- Markets often beat both individual experts and simple regression models
- Combining methods (ensemble) can improve further
- Clean event resolution makes Oscars ideal for testing

### Relevance
Concrete empirical evidence with clear methodology. Good "markets beat experts" citation.

| **Link** | [NTU Repository PDF](https://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/35265/1/12800_Vaughan-Williams.pdf) |

### Summary
High-level survey of prediction market literature covering theory (Hayek, EMH), empirical accuracy, and applications.

### Key Findings
- Theoretical foundations: Hayek's dispersed knowledge, EMH, wisdom of crowds
- Applications span: politics, sports, corporate forecasting, policy evaluation
- Markets are not always efficient—design and context matter
- Growing interest in using markets for organizational decision-making

### Relevance
Good for overview/framing paragraphs. Establishes "there's a real literature here."

### Summary
Systematic review cataloguing use cases and methodological themes in prediction market research up to 2014.

### Key Findings
- Use cases catalogued: politics, sports, governance, corporate decisions
- Methodological themes: accuracy testing, bias detection, mechanism design
- Identifies gaps in literature and future research directions
- Builds on earlier Tziralis & Tatsiopoulos (2006) review

### Relevance
Backbone reference for "there's a real literature here" and identifying research lineage.

| **Year** | 2014 |
| **Venue** | Mercatus Working Paper |
| **Link** | [Mercatus Center](https://www.mercatus.org/research/working-papers/regulation-and-value-prediction-markets) |

### Summary
Overview of why prediction markets matter as information-aggregation tools, and how regulation currently constrains them.

### Key Findings
- Prediction markets provide **public good** via better forecasts
- Current regulatory framework (CFTC, state gambling laws) **hobbles adoption**
- Markets could serve as "public infrastructure" for decision-making
- Regulatory uncertainty deters platform development and liquidity

### Relevance
"This is what's blocking adoption as public infrastructure" angle. Policy/institutional framing.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

| Theme | Key Insight |
|-------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | Markets beat polls ~74% of the time, match or beat macro forecasters |
| **Mechanism** | Aggregation mechanics matter more than trader sophistication |
| **Conditions** | Markets work best with: clear contracts, real stakes, sufficient liquidity |
| **Failures** | Low liquidity, manipulation, misspecified contracts can break markets |
| **Barriers** | Regulatory uncertainty is the main barrier to public adoption |
