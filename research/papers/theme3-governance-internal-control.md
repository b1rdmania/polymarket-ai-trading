| **Authors** | Michael Abramowicz, M. Todd Henderson |
| **Year** | 2006 |
| **Venue** | Coase-Sandor Institute Working Paper / Law & Economics |
| **Link** | [Chicago Unbound PDF](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2342&context=law_and_economics) |

### Summary
Argues firms could use **internal prediction markets** on earnings misses, project delays, or fraud risks to discipline management and improve governance.

### Key Findings
- Markets can aggregate employee knowledge management doesn't see
- Could predict: earnings surprises, project delays, compliance violations, fraud
- Creates "truth-telling" incentive that bypasses hierarchy
- Legal and practical challenges exist but are surmountable

### Governance Implications
- **Internal information markets** could surface risks before they materialize
- Bridges "fun bets" → "serious organisational sensing"
- Relevant for DAOs: on-chain markets on proposal outcomes, treasury risks, hack probabilities

| **Links** | [Econstor PDF](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/146087/1/861712250.pdf) • [RePEc](https://ideas.repec.org/p/ris/vhsuwp/2016_167.html) |

### Summary
Examines whether prediction markets can serve as **internal control tools** — forecasting project failures, budget overruns, etc.

### Key Findings
- Markets **can complement** traditional control systems
- Sometimes **outperform** expert panels and management forecasts
- Work best when: employees have dispersed knowledge, management has blind spots
- Implementation challenges: participation incentives, anonymity, gaming

### Governance Implications
- Prediction markets as **audit/control layer** for organizations
- Could flag: project slippage, budget overruns, team dysfunction
- For crypto: protocol-level markets on upgrade success, security audits, TVL projections
